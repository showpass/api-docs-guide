# About Facebook Pixel

Facebook Pixel (now called Meta Pixel) is a powerful analytics tool that allows event organizers to measure the effectiveness of their advertising by understanding the actions people take on their website. When integrated with Showpass, it provides valuable insights into ticket sales, event discovery, and attendee behavior.

## What is Facebook Pixel?

Facebook Pixel is a piece of code that you add to your website to collect data that helps you track conversions from Facebook ads, optimize ads, build targeted audiences for future ads, and remarket to people who have already taken some kind of action on your website.

## Key Benefits for Event Organizers

### Optimize Ad Campaigns
- Use conversion data to improve ad targeting
- Create lookalike audiences based on successful ticket buyers
- Optimize ad spend for better return on investment (ROI)

### Retargeting Capabilities
- Re-engage users who viewed your events but didn't purchase tickets
- Create custom audiences for future event promotions
- Build audiences based on specific actions (page views, add to cart, purchases)

### Audience Insights
- Understand your audience demographics and interests
- Track the customer journey from ad click to ticket purchase
- Measure the impact of your Facebook marketing efforts

## How Facebook Pixel Works with Showpass

When properly configured, Facebook Pixel tracks several key events in the ticket purchasing process:

- **Page View**: When someone visits your event page
- **View Content**: When someone views specific event details
- **Add to Cart**: When someone adds tickets to their cart
- **Initiate Checkout**: When someone begins the checkout process
- **Purchase**: When someone completes a ticket purchase

## Standard Events Tracked

Showpass automatically tracks these Facebook standard events when properly configured:

| Event | Description | When It Fires |
|-------|-------------|---------------|

| `AddToCart` | Someone adds items to cart | When tickets are added to cart |
| `InitiateCheckout` | Someone begins checkout | When checkout process starts |
| `Purchase` | Someone completes a purchase | When ticket purchase is completed |
