# Ticket Verification

Ticket verification is the first step in the ticket scanning process. Before you can scan, void, or return a ticket, you need to verify it by looking up its details using the barcode or code.

## Overview

The ticket verification endpoint allows you to look up a ticket by its barcode or code. This is an essential first step because:

1. It confirms that the ticket exists and is valid
2. It provides the ticket item ID needed for subsequent operations
3. It returns the current status of the ticket (e.g., "payed", "used", "voided")
4. It provides information about the ticket type, including whether it supports multiple scans

After verifying a ticket, you can proceed to perform actions like scanning (pickup), voiding, or returning the ticket using the Ticket Scan Actions endpoint.

## Authentication

This endpoint requires authentication using a Showpass token:

## Next Steps   

After verifying a ticket, you can perform various actions on the ticket:
1. **Scan the ticket** (mark as used) using the "pickup" action
2. **Void the ticket** (invalidate) using the "void" action
3. **Return a scanned ticket** (undo scan) using the "return" action

All these operations are covered in the [Ticket Scan Actions](/api/12-private-api-ticket-scan-actions) document.
