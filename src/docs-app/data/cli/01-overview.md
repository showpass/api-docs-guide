# Showpass CLI

Build and manage event websites that connect directly to your Showpass venue.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://www.showpass.com/install.sh" | bash
```

## Quick Start

```bash
showpass init my-event-site
```

This launches an interactive wizard that:
- Signs you in to your Showpass account
- Connects to your venue
- Generates a React + TypeScript site with Showpass SDK pre-configured
- Installs dependencies and starts the dev server

Your site will be running at `http://localhost:8080`.
