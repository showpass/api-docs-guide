    "content": "To make it easier for organizers to integrate Showpass with other systems and automate their workflows, Showpass provides webhook functionality. Webhooks allow external systems to be notified when certain events occur in Showpass, such as when a new order is placed or when a ticket transfer occurs.\nBy setting up a webhook to be triggered by a specific event, external systems can be notified in real-time and perform automated actions based on the event data. Below is a list of the events for which Showpass provides webhook support:\n| Event Name | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| invoice.purchase | Triggered when a new order is created |\n| invoice.refund | Triggered when a transaction is refunded |\n| invoice.void | Triggered when a transaction is voided |\n| invoice.transfer | Triggered when a transfer has been completed and new invoices and tickets have been generated |\n| invoice.transferred | Triggered when a transfer has been completed and updates the original invoice and ticket items. Should be used to void original tickets when a transfer is completed. |\nThe Showpass Webhook Objects section describes the format of the webhook objects that will be sent when specific events are triggered. For example, when the \"invoice.purchase\" event is triggered, Showpass will send an \"invoice\" object containing information about the purchase.\nThe invoice object contains detailed information about a purchase, refund, or other transaction-related event.\nHere is an example of a request that we send as a webhook when we're sending the invoice structure:\n- Http Method: 'POST'\n- URL: '$https://yoursite.com/webhook/'\n- Header: 'X-SHOWPASS-SIGNATURE: \"HMAC-SHA1(id, $YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN)\"'\nRequest Body:\n``json\n{\n  \"id\": \"fd-3bc3-463c-8f41-a92971330c06\",\n  \"event_type\": \"invoice.purchase\",\n  \"webhook_event_uuid\": \"06d5dc13-2eea-48ad-9f40-2a5bfc9e4c2c\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"transaction_id\": \"b3-3eb2-405b-b640-39ec45d04fda\",\n    \"showpass_organization_id\": \"20\",\n    \"customer_name\": \""

This is often a great solution for venues with many time-slot based events or if you want to provide a visual calendar view for your users.\nThere are two main ways to add the new calendar:\n1.  As a button that opens the calendar in a pop-up.\n2.  As a calendar embedded directly onto your page.\nNote: The plugin refers to this as \"Calendar Widget V2.0\" in the GitHub readme and recommends it over the older [showpass_calendar] shortcode.\nThis shortcode adds a button to your page. When a user clicks this button, the Showpass event calendar opens in a pop-up window.\nHow to Add:\n1.  Go to the WordPress page or post where you want the button.\n2.  Add a \"Shortcode\" block.\n3.  Type the shortcode: [showpass_calendar_widget]\nBasic Usage:\n[showpass_calendar_widget]\nThis will create a button with the default label \"Get Tickets\".\n- label=\"Your Button Text\"\n  - Use Case: To change the text displayed on the button.\n  - Default: \"Get Tickets\"\n  - Example: [showpass_calendar_widget label=\"View Event Calendar\"]\n- tags=\"your-tag\" (or tags=\"tag1,tag2\")\n  - Use Case: To filter the events displayed in the pop-up calendar by specific Showpass tags (categories). If you remove this parameter, all events will be shown.\n  - Example (Only show events tagged \"comedy\"):\n    [showpass_calendar_widget label=\"Comedy Shows Calendar\" tags=\"comedy\"]\n  - Example (Show all events):\n    [showpass_calendar_widget label=\"Full Event Calendar\"]\nThis shortcode embeds the full calendar directly onto your WordPress page or post.\nHow to Add:\n1.  Go to the WordPress page or post where you want the calendar embedded.\n2.  Add a \"Shortcode\" block.\n3.  Type the shortcode: [showpass_embed_calendar]\nImportant Consideration for Embedded Calendar:\nFor the embedded calendar to display correctly, especially on desktop computers, ensure the container or section of your page where you place this shortcode is at least 1200 pixels wide.

    "content": "The standard Showpass WordPress plugin provides a [showpass_cart_button] shortcode that conveniently includes a text-based cart counter (e.g., \"Shopping Cart (3)\"). This is perfect for most users.\nHowever, if you're looking for a more integrated cart display—perhaps a dynamic counter directly in your website's main navigation menu or a custom header element—you can achieve this with a bit of custom JavaScript. This guide outlines how to implement such a feature.\nPlease Note: This is an advanced customization. It requires familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery), and adding custom code to your WordPress theme. If you're not comfortable with these steps, consider working with a web developer.\nThis custom JavaScript solution will:\n1.  Listen for Cart Updates: It actively listens for changes in the Showpass cart (e.g., when a customer adds a ticket).\n2.  Dynamically Update Your HTML: It updates a specific element on your webpage to show the current number of items in the cart (e.g., \"Cart (2)\" or \"Cart\" if empty).\n3.  Enable Click-to-Open Cart: It allows you to designate an element (like your custom counter or a menu item) that, when clicked, will open the Showpass checkout widget.\n- Showpass WordPress Plugin: Ensure the Showpass plugin is installed and activated.\n- jQuery: WordPress includes jQuery by default, so this should be available on your site.\n- JS-Cookie Library: This JavaScript library is used to interact with cookies. You'll need to add it to your site.\n  - You can download it from GitHub or use a CDN.\n  - A common way to include it is by adding the following line to your theme (ideally via wp_enqueue_script, or for testing, in your theme's header before wp_head()):\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-cookie@3/dist/js.cookie.min.js\"></script>\n- Identifiable HTML Elements: Your website's theme needs to have specific HTML elements that you can target with jQuery:\n  - An element where the cart count text will be displayed (e.g., a <span> ins"

Type the shortcode: [showpass_cart_button]\nBasic Usage (Button opens pop-up cart):\n[showpass_cart_button]\nThis will display a button, typically saying \"Shopping Cart (x)\". When clicked, the Showpass cart/checkout widget will open in a pop-up.\nYou can also embed the entire shopping cart and checkout process directly onto a page, for instance, a dedicated \"Checkout\" page.\nHow to Embed the Cart:\n[showpass_cart_button embedded=\"true\"]\nThis will display the cart interface directly within your page content.\n- embedded=\"true\" (or embedded=\"false\")\n  - Use Case: To display the cart/checkout widget directly on the page instead of as a button that opens a pop-up.\n  - \"false\" (Default): A button is shown.\n  - \"true\": The cart/checkout widget is embedded directly into the page content.\n  - Example (Embedded Cart): [showpass_cart_button embedded=\"true\"]\n- label=\"Your Cart Label\" (This parameter is not explicitly listed in the readme for showpass_cart_button but is common for buttons. Test if needed. The default includes the item count.)\n  - Use Case: Potentially to change the static part of the button's text, though the item count (x) is dynamic.\n  - Example: [showpass_cart_button label=\"View Your Cart\"] (Verify if this customizes the label as expected, or if it's overridden by the dynamic count text).\n- Website Header: Most common and user-friendly location.\n- Sidebar: If your theme has a persistent sidebar.\n- Footer: "

Instead, it returns the raw data fetched from the Showpass API in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. You can then use this JSON data within your own PHP WordPress template files to structure and style the information exactly how you want.\n1.  Identify the Data You Need:\n    - Use the shortcode with template=\"data\" on a test page (e.g., [showpass_events type=\"list\" template=\"data\"]).\n    - View the source of that page or temporarily print the output within your test template to see the full structure of the JSON data returned by the Showpass API. The GitHub Readme (Sections 4.1 for a single event and 4.2 for a list of events) also provides examples of the JSON structure.\n    - While the full JSON contains many fields, for typical event displays, you'll likely focus on these key fields within each item of the results array:\n      - slug: The event slug, crucial for initiating the Showpass purchase widget (e.g., for [showpass_widget slug=\"your-event-slug\"]).\n      - name: The display name of the event.\n      - starts_on: The event's start date and time in UTC format (e.g., \"2024-12-25T19:00:00Z\").\n      - ends_on: The event's end date and time in UTC format.\n      - timezone: The timezone of the event (e.g., \"America/Denver\").

They are little snippets of text in square brackets [] that WordPress magically transforms into dynamic content from Showpass.\nLet's break down a typical Showpass shortcode:\n[showpass_events parameter=\"value\" parameter_2=\"value\"]\n- [ ] (Square Brackets): These are essential. All shortcodes start with [ and end with ].\n- showpass_events (Shortcode Tag): This is the main part of the shortcode. It tells WordPress _which_ Showpass function to run (e.g., showpass_events for event lists/details, showpass_widget for buy buttons, showpass_products for product lists).\n- parameter / parameter_2 (Parameters): These are like settings or options for the shortcode. They modify how the shortcode behaves or what it displays. Not all parameters are needed for every shortcode; many have default values.\n- =\"value\" (Parameter Value): This is the specific setting you're applying to a parameter. The value is usually enclosed in quotes.\nKey Points about Shortcodes:\n- You can have multiple parameters in a single shortcode.\n- There's only one main shortcode tag per set of square brackets (e.g., you can't have [showpass_events showpass_widget]).\n- If you don't provide a parameter, the plugin will use a default value for it.\n- Check Your Organization ID:\n  - Symptom: The list is empty, or it shows events from a completely different organization.\n  - Solution: The most common cause is an incorrect or missing Organization ID in the plugin settings.\n    1.  In your WordPress admin dashboard, go to Showpass API. [1, 2]\n    2.  Double-check that the Organization ID field contains the correct ID for your Showpass venue/organization. [1, 2]\n    3.
