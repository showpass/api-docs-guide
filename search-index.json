Redirecting from your website to showpass.com (e.g., a \"Buy Tickets\" button links directly to an event page on Showpass)\n2. Using the embedded Showpass widget (iFrame) on your website\n> Note: For both scenarios, make sure you’ve added the GTM snippet to your website, inside the head tag.\n---\nIf your website directly links users to pages on showpass.com, you need to configure your Google Tag (used for GA4) in GTM to handle cross-domain tracking. This involves allowing the GA4 tag to \"decorate\" links with linker parameters (_gl).\nGoogle provides detailed instructions on how to configure cross-domain tracking for GA4.

Our native integration includes the Conversions API (CAPI) on the backend, which is complex to set up manually in GTM.\n- Warning: If you enter a Facebook/Meta Pixel ID in the Showpass dashboard _and_ add a Facebook/Meta Pixel tag in GTM, you will double-count conversions and inflate your data.\n- Best Practice: Use Showpass Native settings for Facebook, and use GTM for all other third-party scripts (GA4, Google Ads, Spotify, TikTok, etc.).\nYes. You can setup custom tags in GTM.\n- Event Mapping: Some platforms allow you to use predefined event types or create your own. You can configure tags for specific actions like AddToCart or BeginCheckout by creating triggers for those specific Showpass events and passing the vendor-specific variable\nWe reccomend using the iFrame Purchase Tracking via postMessage\nThis ensures higher accuracy, as it relies on the parent domain sending data to marketing pixels.\n---\nSymptom: You are writing custom JavaScript to reference the GTM Data Layer or Container ID (often in Child/Parent iframe setups), and the script is breaking or returning undefined.\nCause: In JavaScript, a hyphen (-) is treated as a subtraction operator.

Log in to your Showpass Dashboard\n2. Navigate to Organization Settings > Webhooks\n3. Go to \"Events\" tab.\nEach event entry contains the following information:\n- Event Name: Title of the event based on event type.\n- Date: The date event was created.\n- Event Data: The actual JSON payload that was created.\nIn the \"Webhook Attempts\" Section you can see attempts to send this event to your webhook endpoints in the past 15 days:\n- Status: The delivery status of the webhook (e.g., \"Success,\" \"Failed,\" \"Pending\")\n- Webhook URL: The URL to which the event was sent\n- Date: The date and time Showpass attempted to send the event\n- Resend Menu: The trigger for resending the webhook\nIf a webhook event failed to deliver (e.g., due to a temporary issue with your server or network), the Showpass dashboard may offer an option to resend that specific event.\nThis is useful for recovering missed notifications without needing the original action to be performed again in Showpass\n> Note: Be mindful of idempotency in your receiving application if you resend events, to avoid duplicate processing\n---\nSeparate from individual event logs, there is a more general Webhook \"Logs\" section or a summary view that provides an overview of the health and delivery status of your webhook endpoints.\nIt helps in identifying if a particular endpoint is consistently failing or experiencing issues\nIn this section you can see 3 tabs:\n- All\n- Succeeded\n- Failed\nEach webhook log has these details:\n- HTTP Status Code: The HTTP response code received from your endpoint (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error)\n- ID: Id"

Go to WordPress Admin → Showpass API\n2. Verify Organization ID matches your Showpass account\n3. Find your Organization ID in Showpass dashboard under Organization/Venue Settings\n4. Save changes in WordPress\n> Note: If the Organization ID is wrong or blank, no events (or incorrect events) will display.\n---\nSymptoms:\n- Shortcode shows as text on the page\n- Layout is broken or nothing renders\nSolution: Use straight quotes, not curly \"smart\" quotes\n✅ Correct:\n`text\n[showpass_events type=\"list\" tags=\"concert\"]\n[showpass_events type='list' tags='concert']\n`\n❌ Incorrect (curly quotes):\n`text\n[showpass_events type=\"list\" tags=\"concert\"]\n`\n> Tip: Curly quotes often come from copying from Word, Google Docs, or email. Paste as plain text or use the Shortcode block in WordPress.\n---\nCommon mistakes:\n- Incorrect tag: showpas_events instead of showpass_events\n- Wrong parameter: pagesize instead of page_size\n- Mixed quotes: type=\"list' (mixes double and single quotes)\nSolution: Double-check spelling and syntax against documentation examples.\n---\nSymptoms: All shortcodes show as plain text\nSolution:\n1.
