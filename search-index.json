You can use this API to display events on your website, build custom integrations, or create your own applications that interact with Showpass events.\nThe Public Event API is open and does not generally require authentication tokens for basic public event queries. However, for your requests to be successful, your website's domain must be added to the allowlist in the Showpass Dashboard. You can do this under your organization's settings, typically found on the \"Integrations\" tab of your venue edit page (https://www.showpass.com/dashboard/venues/edit/).\nAll API responses are returned in JSON format.\nYou can refine your event list query using the following optional parameters:\n| Parameter               | Type     | Status   | Description                                                                                                                                         |\n| ----------------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| search_string         | String   | Optional | A search query string.

Redirecting from your website to showpass.com (e.g., a \"Buy Tickets\" button links directly to an event page on Showpass).\n2.  Using the embedded Showpass widget (iFrame) on your website.\nIf your website directly links users to pages on showpass.com, you need to configure your Google Tag (used for GA4) in GTM to handle cross-domain tracking. This involves allowing the GA4 tag to \"decorate\" links with linker parameters (_gl).\nSetup Instructions:\nGoogle provides detailed instructions on how to configure cross-domain tracking for GA4. Please refer to their official help article:\n- Google Analytics Help - Set up cross-domain measurement [GA4]: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10071811\nKey steps typically involve:\n1.  Navigating to your Google Tag (the one used for GA4 Configuration, e.g., GA4 - Configuration - All Pages) in GTM.\n2.  Under Configuration Settings > Configure domains, add the domains involved (e.g., yourdomain.com, showpass.com).\n3.  Ensure your GA4 data stream settings in the GA4 UI are also configured for cross-domain tracking by adding the relevant domains.\nTracking user activity accurately within an iFrame (like the Showpass embedded purchase widget) presents challenges, especially with browser privacy features that restrict third-party cookies.\n- For the most accurate tracking of widget conversions within GTM, Showpass strongly recommends using the postMessage iFrame tracking method.\n- This technique allows the iFrame to communicate data directly to the parent page (your website), bypassing many common cross-domain and third-party cookie issues.\n- This method is detailed in Section 8: \"Advanced & Preferred: iFrame Purc"

The Data Layer is a JavaScript object that GTM uses to receive information from your website or, in this case, from Showpass services.\nShowpass implements a dynamic naming convention for the Data Layer variable to support scenarios where multiple GTM containers or data layers might coexist on a page.\n- If your GTM Container ID is, for example, GTM-12345678, the Data Layer variable name that Showpass will use and push data to will be:\n  dataLayer_GTM_12345678\n- The general format is: dataLayer_GTM_YOUR-CONTAINER-ID (replacing YOUR-CONTAINER-ID with your actual GTM ID without the GTM- prefix, or verify the exact name in your browser console). The provided example implies the GTM- prefix is _included_ in the variable name, so dataLayer_GTM_12345678 is the format to expect.\nImportant: When you are setting up Data Layer Variables in GTM (as described in Section 6 for ecommerce parameters), you typically do not need to specify this full dynamic name in the \"Data Layer Variable Name\" field in GTM. GTM is designed to work with the concept of a \"data layer\" and will usually pick up pushes to any array named dataLayer or specifically named ones if configured correctly at a deeper GTM level or via custom JavaScript. For standard Data Layer Variable configuration in GTM, you just use the key name (e.g., ecommerce.value).\nIf you need to access the Showpass-specific Data Layer directly within a Custom JavaScript Variable in GTM or a Custom HTML tag script, you would use its dynamic name:\n``javascript\n// Example: Accessing the Showpass specific dataLayer in a GTM Custom JavaScript Variable\n// Replace GTM-12345678 with YOUR actual GTM Container ID\nvar specificDataLayer = window.dataLayer_GTM_12345678;\n// You can then iterate over it or access its properties\nif (specificDataLayer) {\n  for (var i = 0; i < specificDataLayer.length; i++) {\n   "

    "content": "Tracking conversions and user activity accurately within an iFrame (like the Showpass embedded purchase widget) is a significant challenge due to browser privacy measures that increasingly block third-party cookies and tracking mechanisms.\nTo overcome this, Showpass advocates for a more robust method: iFrame tracking using the postMessage API. This technique allows secure communication between the Showpass iFrame (child) and your website (parent page), enabling the iFrame to send event data directly to your GTM container on the parent page.\n- Accuracy: Bypasses many issues related to third-party cookie restrictions, leading to more reliable data.\n- Privacy-Focused: Relies on direct communication rather than cross-domain cookie sharing for event data.\n- Recommended: Considered a best practice for iFrame tracking in modern web analytics.\nFor more context on iFrame tracking challenges and solutions:\n- Jellyfish Training - How to Track iFrames with Google Tag Manager: https://www.jellyfish.com/en-gb/training/blog/how-track-iframes-google-tag-manager\n- MeasureSchool - iFrame Tracking with Google Tag Manager: https://measureschool.com/iframe-tracking/\nThis setup involves two Google Tag Manager containers:\n1.  Child GTM Container (for the Showpass iFrame):\n    - This container is specifically for the Showpass widget environment.\n    - Showpass will provide you with a new, empty GTM Container ID for this purpose. You will need to request this from Showpass support or your account manager.\n    - Its role is to capture ecommerce events within the iFrame and postMessage them to the parent window (your website).\n2.  Main/Parent GTM Container (on your website):\n    - This is your existing GTM container that manages tracking for your primary website.\n    - Its role is to listen for messages from the Showpass iFrame and then push that data into its own dataLayer to trigger your standard ecommerce tags (e.g., GA4, marketing pixels).\n---\nYou (or Showpass, with your input) will confi"

    "content": "In some advanced scenarios, you might want to differentiate GTM tag firing behavior based on whether an event originates from within the embedded Showpass widget (iFrame on your site) or from a direct interaction on showpass.com (if your GTM container is also deployed there, or if Showpass sends server-side events that populate your website's GTM).\nThis allows for more granular control, such as:\n- Applying different attributions.\n- Sending slightly different data to certain marketing tags.\n- Preventing duplicate firing if events could be captured through both postMessage (from the iFrame) and direct Data Layer pushes (on showpass.com or via server events).\nThe key is to create a GTM variable that detects if the current context is an iFrame.\nThis variable will return true if the GTM container is currently operating within an iFrame, and false otherwise.\n1.  In your Main/Parent GTM container (your website's GTM), go to Variables.\n2.  Under \"User-Defined Variables,\" click New.\n3.  Name your variable: Custom JS - Is iFrame (or similar).\n4.  Variable Configuration:\n    - Choose variable type: Custom JavaScript.\n    - Paste the following script:\n      ``javascript\n      function() {\n        try {\n          // window.self refers to the current window.\n          // window.top refers to the topmost window in the window hierarchy.\n          // If they are not the same, the current window is in an iFrame.\n          return window.top !== window.self;\n        } catch (e) {\n          // Catch potential errors if window.top is inaccessible due to cross-origin restrictions,\n          // though less common for this specific check.\n          return false;\n        }\n      }\n      `\n5.

You can use it to open purchase widgets as pop-up dialogs or embed them seamlessly into your page layout.\nPlease note: Your domain must have a valid SSL certificate (https://) installed for the SDK to work properly.\nYou have two primary options for including the Showpass SDK:\nInclude the SDK with a standard <script> tag using either the async or defer attribute to prevent blocking your page's rendering. Place this tag in the <head> of your HTML or before your closing </body> tag.\nUsing async:\nThe script will be downloaded in parallel with the browser parsing the HTML page and executed as soon as it's available.\n``html\n<script\n  type=\"text/javascript\"\n  src=\"https://showpass.com/static/dist/sdk.js\"\n  async\n></script>\n`\nUsing defer (recommended):\nThe script will be downloaded in parallel with HTML parsing but only executed after the HTML document has been fully parsed.

This guide explains how to use Showpass webhooks and integrate them with your applications.\n- Endpoint: A publicly accessible URL on your server or third-party service (e.g., Zapier, Slack) to which Showpass will send HTTP POST requests containing event data.\n- Event: An action or occurrence that takes place within the Showpass application, such as a user making a purchase (invoice.purchase), transferring a ticket (invoice.transfer), or a transaction being refunded (invoice.refund) or voided (invoice.void).\n- Payload: The data sent from Showpass to your endpoint when an event occurs. This data is typically in JSON format and contains details about the event (e.g., for an invoice.purchase event, the payload would be an Invoice object).\n- Logs: Showpass maintains logs of webhook events sent to your configured endpoints, including their success or failure status. This is useful for monitoring and troubleshooting.\n- Secret Key: A unique token provided by Showpass when you set up an endpoint. This key is used to generate a signature for each webhook request, allowing you to verify that the request legitimately originated from Showpass.\n- Real-time Notifications: Get immediate updates as events happen in Showpass.\n- Automation: Trigger workflows in your own systems (e.g., update a CRM, send custom email notifications, sync with accounting software, manage mailing lists).\n- Integration: Connect Showpass data with other third-party applications and services.\n- Effic"

This signature allows you to verify that the webhook request genuinely originated from Showpass and was not tampered with during transmission.\nIt is crucial to implement signature verification on your server to ensure the security and integrity of your webhook integration.\n1.  Secret Key: When you create a new webhook endpoint in the Showpass dashboard, Showpass generates a unique Secret Key (also referred to as a Webhook Token). This key is shared only between Showpass and you. You must store this key securely on your server.\n2.  Signature Generation (Showpass side):\n    - Before sending a webhook, Showpass creates a signature using the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm.\n    - The signature is a hash generated from the id field of the webhook payload (which is typically the transaction_id for invoice-related events) and your unique Secret Key.\n    - The formula looks something like this: HMAC-SHA1(payload_id, your_secret_key)\n3.  Sending the Webhook: Showpass sends the HTTP POST request to your endpoint. The request includes:\n    - The JSON payload in the request body.\n    - The X-SHOWPASS-SIGNATURE header containing the generated signature.\n4.  Signature Verification (Your server side):\n    - When your endpoint receives a webhook request:\n      a. Extract the id from the JSON payload in the request body.\n      b. Retrieve the X-SHOWPASS-SIGNATURE header value.\n      c. Using the same HMAC-SHA1 algorithm, generate your own signature using the extracted id from the payload and your securely stored Secret Key for that endpoint.\n      d. Compare the signature you generated with the signature received in the X-SHOWPASS-SIGNATURE header.\n      e. If the signatures match, the request is authentic and can be trusted.\n      f. If the signatures do not match, the request may be fraudulent or corrupted, and you should discard it.\nThe X-SHOWPASS-SIGNATURE h"

Enable Click-to-Open Cart: It allows you to designate an element (like your custom counter or a menu item) that, when clicked, will open the Showpass checkout widget.\n- Showpass WordPress Plugin: Ensure the Showpass plugin is installed and activated.\n- jQuery: WordPress includes jQuery by default, so this should be available on your site.\n- JS-Cookie Library: This JavaScript library is used to interact with cookies. You'll need to add it to your site.\n  - You can download it from GitHub or use a CDN.\n  - A common way to include it is by adding the following line to your theme (ideally via wp_enqueue_script, or for testing, in your theme's header before wp_head()):\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-cookie@3/dist/js.cookie.min.js\"></script>\n- Identifiable HTML Elements: Your website's theme needs to have specific HTML elements that you can target with jQuery:\n  - An element where the cart count text will be displayed (e.g., a <span> ins"

    "content": "Showpass allows you to use affiliate tracking links to monitor the sales performance of different marketing channels or partners. When a customer arrives at your website through one of these special tracking links, the Showpass WordPress plugin can automatically associate any subsequent purchases made through the [showpass_widget] (for events) with that tracking link.\n1.  Create an Affiliate Tracking Link in Showpass:\n    - First, you need to generate an affiliate tracking link within your Showpass dashboard. For detailed instructions on how to do this, please refer to the Showpass support documentation: http://support.showpass.com/event-organizers/tracking-links/affiliate-tracking-links\n    - When you create this link, Showpass will provide you with a unique token (e.g., 8ee54af5).\n2.  Customer Clicks the Tracking Link:\n    - You share this full tracking link (e.g., https://www.showpass.com/your-event/?tracking-id=8ee54af5 or however Showpass formats it) in your campaign or with your affiliate.\n    - When a customer clicks this link, they are taken to Showpass.\n3.  Using the aff Query Parameter on Your Website:\n    - To integrate this with your WordPress site where the Showpass plugin and [showpass_widget] shortcode are used, you'll need to get the customer to _your site_ with a special URL parameter.\n    - Add the aff query parameter to the URL of your website page where the Showpass widget button is. The value of this parameter should be the unique token from your Showpass tracking link.\n    - Example URL for your website:\n      https://yourwebsite.com/event-page/?aff=8ee54af5\n      (Replace 8ee54af5 with your actual tracking token).\n    - When a user visits your site using such a URL, the plugin creates a cookie on their browser that stores this aff token.\n4.  Automatic Tracking ID Injection:\n    - The [showpass_widget] shortcode (specifically when type=\"event\") is automatically designed to look for this cookie.\n    - If the cookie with the aff token is present,"

    "content": "While the Showpass WordPress Plugin provides default templates for displaying event lists you might want to create your own unique layouts and designs.\nThis is an advanced topic that requires some knowledge of PHP, HTML, and WordPress theme development.\nThe key to creating custom templates is the template=\"data\" parameter available for the relevant shortcodes:\n[showpass_events template=\"data\"]\nWhen you use template=\"data\", the shortcode doesn't output any HTML. Instead, it returns the raw data fetched from the Showpass API in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. You can then use this JSON data within your own PHP WordPress template files to structure and style the information exactly how you want.\n1.  Identify the Data You Need:\n    - Use the shortcode with template=\"data\" on a test page (e.g., [showpass_events type=\"list\" template=\"data\"]).\n    - View the source of that page or temporarily print the output within your test template to see the full structure of the JSON data returned by the Showpass API. The GitHub Readme (Sections 4.1 for a single event and 4.2 for a list of events) also provides examples of the JSON structure.\n    - While the full JSON contains many fields, for typical event displays, you'll likely focus on these key fields within each item of the results array:\n      - slug: The event slug, crucial for initiating the Showpass purchase widget (e.g., for [showpass_widget slug=\"your-event-slug\"]).\n      - name: The display name of the event.\n      - starts_on: The event's start date and time in UTC format (e.g., \"2024-12-25T19:00:00Z\").\n      - ends_on: The event's end date and time in UTC format.\n      - timezone: The timezone of the event (e.g., \"America/Denver\"). Used with helper functions to display local times.\n      - description: The event description, which may include HTML formatting. Use wp_kses_post() when displaying this if you want to render the HTML safely.\n      - description_without_html: The event description with all HTML tags"

    "content": "Sometimes, you might want the Showpass ticket-buying widget to open automatically as soon as a customer lands on a specific page on your website. This can be useful for targeted landing pages where the primary call to action is to purchase tickets for a particular event.\nThe Showpass WordPress plugin supports this functionality using a URL query parameter: auto.\nYou append ?auto=your-event-slug to the URL of the WordPress page where you want the widget to auto-open.\n- your-event-slug: This is the slug of the Showpass event you want to feature in the pop-up widget. The slug is the unique part of the event's URL on Showpass (e.g., if the event is at showpass.com/my-big-concert, the slug is my-big-concert).\nWhen a user visits this specially crafted URL, the plugin will detect the auto parameter and automatically trigger the Showpass ticket widget for the specified event slug to open in a pop-up.\n- Directing from Ad Campaigns: If you run an ad campaign for a specific event, you can link the ad directly to a page on your site with the ?auto=event-slug parameter. The widget for that event opens immediately, streamlining the purchase process.\n- Dedicated Event Landing Pages: If you have a landing page on your WordPress site focused solely on one event, automatically opening the widget can reduce clicks and potentially increase conversions.\n- Email Marketing Links: Link from an email newsletter about a specific event to your website page with the widget auto-opening.\nLet's say you have a WordPress page at yourwebsite.com/featured-event/.\nYour Showpass event slug is annual-gala-2024.\nTo make the widget for \"Annual Gala 2024\" open automatically when someone visits that page, you would use or share this URL:\nhttps://yourwebsite.com/featured-event/?auto=annual-gala-2024\nImportant Considerations:\n- User Experience: While auto-opening widgets can be effective, use this feature thoughtfully. Unexpected pop-ups can sometimes be intrusive. Ensure it makes sense in the user's journey"

    "content": "Here are some common tips and troubleshooting steps to help you get the most out of the Showpass WordPress Plugin and resolve any issues you might encounter.\nShortcodes are the backbone of this plugin. They are little snippets of text in square brackets [] that WordPress magically transforms into dynamic content from Showpass.\nLet's break down a typical Showpass shortcode:\n[showpass_events parameter=\"value\" parameter_2=\"value\"]\n- [ ] (Square Brackets): These are essential. All shortcodes start with [ and end with ].\n- showpass_events (Shortcode Tag): This is the main part of the shortcode. It tells WordPress _which_ Showpass function to run (e.g., showpass_events for event lists/details, showpass_widget for buy buttons, showpass_products for product lists).\n- parameter / parameter_2 (Parameters): These are like settings or options for the shortcode. They modify how the shortcode behaves or what it displays. Not all parameters are needed for every shortcode; many have default values.\n- =\"value\" (Parameter Value): This is the specific setting you're applying to a parameter. The value is usually enclosed in quotes.\nKey Points about Shortcodes:\n- You can have multiple parameters in a single shortcode.\n- There's only one main shortcode tag per set of square brackets (e.g., you can't have [showpass_events showpass_widget]).\n- If you don't provide a parameter, the plugin will use a default value for it.\n- Check Your Organization ID:\n  - Symptom: The list is empty, or it shows events from a completely different organization.\n  - Solution: The most common cause is an incorrect or missing Organization ID in the plugin settings.\n    1.  In your WordPress admin dashboard, go to Showpass API. [1, 2]\n    2.  Double-check that the Organization ID field contains the correct ID for your Showpass venue/organization. [1, 2]\n    3.  You can find your Organization ID by logging into your Showpass account and navigating to https://www.showpass.com/dashboard/venues/edit/ or the 'Organizat"
